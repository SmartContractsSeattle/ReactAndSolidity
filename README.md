Basic ingredients:
Create React App (out of the box node and functioning React app)
Remix (building and deploying solidity smart contracts to the Rinkeby testnet)
Metamask (facilitating Ethereum network transactions, via web3)

CHALLENGE
Seattle Smart Contracts Hackers:
Using arrays in Solidity, improve upon Zubair's setExperimentInMotion function, to return a more random result.
